## Initial MVP idea:
â€‹
 We initially thought about what could set our application apart from other finance apps, and we came up with the idea of producing motivational and funny messages based on whether the user can afford a purchase or not. We then discussed which API we would use and how this would allow the user to track spending. We started to concider the layout of the different pages of the application and decided, based upon early wireframes, that we would have a seperate page for returing users to login as well as for new users to create an account. We decided on an initial color scheme and elements of different pages and discussed how we would implement them 

<< consider talking about how you planned as a team here and what tools were implemented >>

### Color Scheme:

This website uses a palette of subtle colours that are simple yet eye catching to attract and keep users in the website. 
This palette was created using [Coolors](https://coolors.co/000000-404040-20b2aa-008b8b-ffffff) website

- Montserrat was used throughout the website. 
- It promotes readability and maintains a clean design.
